<h2>"SLIDING CIRCLES"</h2>
<p>
<hr>
This question is based on the Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) Scale (Aron, Aron, & Smollan, 1992).

<p>Note that the value measured is proportional to the distance travelled by the "Self" circle.
<br>It is NOT proportional to the area of overlap, so if you want the area, you will have to do some calculations later on.

<p>Reference:
<br>Aron, A., Aron, E. N., &amp; Smollan, D. (1992). Inclusion of other in the self scale and the structure of interpersonal closeness. Journal of personality and social psychology, 63(4), 596.

<h4>BASIC PROCEDURE</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a Slider type question in Qualtrics.</li>
<li>Add the question content:
	<br>a. Click on the question text to edit it.
	<br>b. Using the HTML View, copy and paste the contents of "question-html.txt".
	<br>c. Once done, click outside the editing area. You should now see two labelled circles appearing as the content of the question.</li>
<li>Adjust the options of the question:
	<br>a. Set Choices = 1, so that there is only one slider.
	<br>b. Set Labels as necessary. I set it to 2 to label the anchors on either end of the slider ("not at all" and "completely").
	<br>c. Set Type = Sliders.
	<br>d. Set the min and max value of the slider. I recommend min = 0, max = 100, decimals = 0.</li>
<li>Add JavaScript to the question:
	<br>a. Right-click on the question (or click on the gear icon to the left of the question), and select "Add JavaScript...".
	<br>b. Copy and paste the contents of "question-javascript.txt".
	<br>c. Make changes to the "CONFIGURATION" section of the JavaScript as required. See the comments in the code for details.</li>

<p>Hope this works for you!

<p>p.s. An additional feature:
<li>If you want to set the initial state of the slider according to a value from a previous question/survey:
	<br>a. Use an embedded data named "initialSliderValue".
	<br>b. Check "Custom Start Position" and "Show Value" in the question's options.
	<br>c. Right-click on the question (or click on the gear icon to the left of the question), and select "Add Default Choices..."
	<br>d. In the pop-up titled "Edit Default Choices", click on the textbox to the right of the slider and fill it with <code>${e://Field/initialSliderValue}</code>. Remember to click "Save".
	<br>e. After completing step d, you may uncheck the "Show Value" option if you want.</li>
</ol>
