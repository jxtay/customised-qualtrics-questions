# Customised Qualtrics Questions
A collection of customised Qualtrics questions. These usually involve using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Qualtrics' own js-based Questions API and embedded data to expand the types of questions you can have in a survey.

Each question type will be kept in a separate folder, and each folder will contain the instructions and codes required for the question to work. I will try to make the instructions as clear as possible so that you do not necessarily need to know how to program in order to implement these questions in Qualtrics. However, you are expected to know how to use Qualtrics, and if not, please refer to their documentation.

A brief description of the collection:
- sliding-circles: Using Slider question to control how much two circles are overlapping. Adapted from personality/identity research
- 

More will be added in the near future. I have a few more for which I need to find time to write up the instructions.


NOTE: Wherever I use/adapt code I found from elsewhere, I try to attribute clearly (unless it's very generic stuff). If you feel you should be credited for something and were not, please let me know. Thanks!
